# Text-Classification
Classify mystery text based on parameters and text doc input--simple case
<p>
<p>This project was inspired by the discovery that "The Cuckoo's Calling," published under pseudonym Robert Galbraith, was in fact authored by J. K. Rowling. Many people ran "The Cuckoo's Calling" text through linguistic programs and compared it with several other books and based on a series of weights, given by word length, frequency of word usages...etc, they were able to figure out that Rowling was the real writer using 'Galbraih' as a pen name. https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2013/07/19/how-forensic-linguistics-outed-j-k-rowling-not-to-mention-james-madison-barack-obama-and-the-rest-of-us/
<p>I will just be uploading a simplified version of a text scanner that will try to classify mystery texts. Note that parameters can be improved through various ways depending on the types of texts you intend to use and outcomes you want.
<p> In the .py file, you will see that 2 texts, BBT (Big Bang Theory pilot episode transcript) and Friends (pilot episode transcript) were inputed as text files while parameters were set up to determine the similarities between the 2. Based on the mystery text that you decide to test out (can be from any source), the code will determine the text that is weighted as closely to the inputed text.
<p> Code was written for intro CS class in college taught by Dr. David Sullivan, http://cs-people.bu.edu/dgs/
